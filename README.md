# TensorFlow 1.x Deep Learning Cookbook
This is the code repository for [TensorFlow 1.x Deep Learning Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/tensorflow-1x-deep-learning-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293594), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved a lot of success in the field of computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The entire world is filled with excitement about how deep networks are revolutionizing artificial intelligence. This exciting recipe-based guide will take you from the realm of DNN theory to implementing them practically to solve the real-life problems in artificial intelligence domain.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<Contextpath="/jira"docBase="${catalina.home}
/atlassian- jira" reloadable="false" useHttpOnly="true">
```
